Hello, world! 

I am Mohamed Messaoud Louamri, a Ph.D. student specializing in nonlinear phenomena in dusty plasma physics. Additionally, I am a member of Constantine Quantum Technologies ([CQTech](https://cqtech.org)), where I conduct research, develop algorithms, and explore business applications for Quantum and AI technologies, with a particular interest in Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Optimization. 

In my spare time, I enjoy building web, software, and hardware projects and discussing fundamental physics.

Only daily basis, I use [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/), [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit). I have some notions (and built things) in many languages like C, C++, Assembly, Typescript, ... but I am not very proficient nor use them anymore. I want to learn [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)), and I am curious about [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo).

For my side projects, I use [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (with Livewire and Tailwindcss), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), etc.

Some projects that I worked on include:
* [A Quantum Random Number Generation Package (`cqt_rng`)](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/cqt_rng)
* [A Topological Quantum Simulator (`tqsim`)](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/tqsim)
