Hello, world! 

I am Mohamed Messaoud Louamri, a Ph.D. student specializing in nonlinear phenomena in dusty plasma physics. Additionally, I am a researcher and algorithm developer at Constantine Quantum Technologies (([CQTech](https://cqtech.org))), focusing on Quantum and AI technologies, particularly their intersection (Quantum Artificial Intelligence). My work involves theoretical exploration and practical business applications, pushing the boundaries of what these advanced technologies achieve.

In my spare time, I build web, software, and hardware projects, and enjoy discussing fundamental physics, mathematics, and philosophy.

On a daily basis, I use Python, Pennylane, and Qiskit. I have some experience with various languages like C, C++, Assembly, and TypeScript, though I don't use them frequently. I am interested in learning Rust and Julia, and I am curious about Mojo.

For my side projects, I use Laravel (with Livewire and Tailwind CSS), Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.

Some projects that I worked on include:
* [A Quantum Random Number Generation Package (`cqt_rng`)](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/cqt_rng)
* [A Topological Quantum Simulator (`tqsim`)](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/tqsim)
