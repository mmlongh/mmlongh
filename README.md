# Hello, world ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Mohamed Messaoud Louamri! I am interested by the intersection of science and computing â€” how can science inspire advanced computing methods like quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, thermodynamic computing, reservoir computing, and so on, and, conversely, how computers can enable and accelerate scientific discovery.

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene (USTHB) in Algeria, where I use analytical and computational tools to study, simulate, explain, and predict nonlinear waves in dusty plasma physics.

Additionally, I am a researcher at Constantine Quantum Technologies ([CQTech](https://cqtech.org)). I have explored ways to use quantum computers for robust data encryption ([QRNG](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/cqt_rng)), determining the ground states of chemical (BeH2) and condensed matter systems (Kagome Lattices), optimizing industry-related processes (Warehouse optimization), etc.

Currently, Iâ€™m investigating how classical machine learning algorithms can be enhanced by introducing quantum (sub)routines.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on software and hardware projects, as well as discussing topics in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and philosophy.

## What did I do?
- I built [cqt_rng](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/cqt_rng), an open-source package to generate random numbers using quantum entropy sources.
- Helped building [tqsim](https://github.com/Constantine-Quantum-Tech/tqsim), an open-source package to simulate anyonic quantum circuits.
